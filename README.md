How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by focusing on what the end user is really trying to achieve, not just the technical details. Writing user stories makes this easier because they follow a simple structure: “As a user, I want to ___ so that ___.” This format helps me clearly see the value behind each feature and keeps development tied to the user’s goals instead of just adding functions without purpose.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs step by step, starting with small, working features and then improving them over time. Agile has shown me the benefit of working in short sprints, testing often, and adjusting quickly when requirements change. Going forward, I want to keep using user stories, retrospectives, and sprint planning. These processes keep development flexible, reduce wasted effort, and make it easier to deliver something useful at every stage.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating often, staying transparent, and being willing to adapt when things change. It’s about collaborating with the group instead of just focusing on my own tasks. A strong team member looks out for blockers, offers help when others are stuck, and keeps the project moving forward. I’ve learned that good teamwork is just as important as coding skills when it comes to delivering quality software.
