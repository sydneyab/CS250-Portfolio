## Portfolio Reflection – The Gaming Room

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application that could support multiple platforms. The software needed to allow multiple users to play at the same time while ensuring only one instance of the game service was running. It also needed to enforce unique names for games, teams, and players and be designed in a way that could scale as the application grows.

One thing I did particularly well when developing this documentation was clearly outlining the system requirements and constraints before making design decisions. Breaking the problem down early helped keep the design organized and made it easier to explain the reasoning behind architectural choices.

Working through a full design document before writing code was helpful because it forced me to think through the structure of the system ahead of time. Planning the architecture, class relationships, and constraints first made the code easier to understand and reduced the need for rework later.

If I could revise one part of the documentation, I would expand the platform evaluation section to include more detail about performance tradeoffs and long-term maintenance. This would make the recommendation more useful for real-world decision making.

User needs were addressed by focusing on scalability, reliability, and ease of use. Considering user needs is important because software that ignores them may work technically but fail in practice.

I approached the design by identifying requirements first and then breaking the system into smaller components using object-oriented principles. In the future, I would continue using techniques such as UML diagrams, incremental design, and early planning when designing similar applications.
